/*******************************************************************************
 * This program is a slot machine simulation, in which you press a button
 * and three images change randomly. You have a $1000 when you start the program
 * and everytime you hit play, you pay a dollar. To win you need to match three
 * of the images. Depending on which image you match your price is going
 * to be different. There are eight different images and eight different prices.
 * This program is a multiplethread application, which allows you  to
 * perform more than one action at the same time.
 * This program shares a lot of similarities with the one that was witten by
 * Diana Esteves. But for this program I chose the topic I like the most, which
 * is the Formula 1. The pictures that are going to be displayed are Formula 1
 * drivers. The relationship driver-price depends on the results of the 2010
 * season of the Formula 1.
 * Sounds and music play a very important role in this game. What kind of game
 * would this program be without any sound or music. All sounds and music that
 * is used in this program is not self-made. In the following list IÂ´m attaching
 * the resources where all the audio comes from:
